# DSA_CashFlowMinimizer
This marvelous project under DSA, The Cash Flow Minimizer is designed to reduce unnecessary transactions in group payments, inspired by how friends split bills in canteens. Instead of multiple individual payments, it efficiently minimizes cash flow using Graph Theory and Greedy Algorithms.
